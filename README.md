# SO-Excel

Every now and then I stumble over excellent answers on StackOverflow.
Of course I could star them (to be precise, not the answer but rather it's
question is starred).
However, I feel there is a need to collect these awesome sources.
Maybe this becomes a book at some day, who knows.

Answers will be copied from the website, probably some editing is required to
fix typos, layout and formatting.
Questions, however, will probably not be copied.
Most very good questions usually make sense without the context of a question,
in the other cases some explanation is probably preferable.
